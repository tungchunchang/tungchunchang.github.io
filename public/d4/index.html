# collection of codes and guidelines for uniform formatting of figures across softwares

## best practice for print

* Nature: line weights and strokes should be set between 0.25 and 1 pt at the final size
* OUP: ensure that a consistent, embedded typeface is used. Common typefaces such as Times New Roman, Arial, Helvetica, Courier or Symbol are recommended to ensure clear reproduction and the retention of any special characters. 
* OUP: as a rule of thumb, text should appear no smaller than 7pt at intended size (6pt for superscript and subscript characters), and should be of consistent size throughout the figure
* Springer: To add lettering, it is best to use Helvetica or Arial (sans serif fonts). Keep lettering consistently sized throughout your final-sized artwork, usually about 2â€“3 mm (8â€“12 pt). Variance of type size within an illustration should be minimal, e.g., do not use 8-pt type on an axis and 20-pt type for the axis label.
* For other shorter text settings â€“ such as captions, credits, column headings, as well as text in charts and graphs â€“ a sans serif typeface can be a good choice. Its simplified letterforms are unencumbered by serifs, which can impede the readability of characters at very small sizes.
* APA: For any text in figures, authors should use a sans serif typeface, because the clean and simple lines enhance the figureâ€™s visual presentation. The preferred font is either Arial, Futura, or Helvetica, and font size may range from 8 to 14 points.

## some tips

* very easy to transform multipage PDF to multiple EPS files with `adobe pro`
* export to EPS but in `settings/color management` make sure no `color management`
use `file values`.

---

## graphs for papers

### 2 graphs on one line [scale = 0.2]

* font: Helvetica (classic sans serif font)
* color: black
* size: 8pt Helvetica, which is equivalent to 9pt Times New Roman (TNR) (footnote size in publication)
* if there is too much text, the text can be scaled down as low as 7pt

#### keynote

* font: `helvetica`
* font size: 40pt (which is scaled at 0.2 to give 8pt)
* font color: `black`in baseline palette
* pointer/level line: 2pt (but lighter color)
* axis: 2pt
* main lines: 6pt (4pt--8pt)
* old lines (in comparative statics): 1/3 thick * dashed
* intersection circles: 22pt
* for diagram colors, use `qualitative paired` or `qualitative accent` or `qualitative dark2`
* can use the grays from baseline palette (see `material` for more choice of grays)

#### matlab

* `format`  gives the formatting for figures, which matches `latexit` and `keynote`
* about twice as large as keynote
* all black
* font: `helvetica`
* font size: 22pt (matches `keynote` exactly)
* linewdith: 3pt (2pt--4pt)
* axis width: 1pt
* circular marker: 9pt--11pt
* `paired` gives the colors from `qualitative paired` 
* `accent` gives the colors from `qualitative accent`
* `dark2` gives the colors from `qualitative dark2`

#### latexit

* `latexit.sty` gives Helvetica with corresponding sans serif math, in black
* set `latexit` size to 40pt
* numbers in math are helvetica thanks to `textasmath`
* greek `newtxsf` and Helvetica match nicely (with scaling 1.1 for `newtxsf`)

other `latexit` settings: 
* 5pt border
* PDF with outlined font
* no background (white)
* preamble:
`\documentclass[10pt]{article}
\usepackage{latexit,math}`


### 1 graph on one line [scale = 0.3 for two vertical graphs; scale = 0.4 for one graph]

* this is only for publication graphs where they give you as much space as desired for figures (OUP and maybe AEA)
* could also be for particularly important or complex figures
* idea is to keep the same appearance as other figures but with more surface covered since height and width are larger:
    * when scale is 0.3 instead of 0.2, idea is to scale down everything coming from latexit, keynote, and matlab by 2/3
    * when scale is 0.4 instead of 0.2, idea is to scale down everything coming from latexit, keynote, and matlab by 1/2

#### keynote

40pt * 2/3 = 27pt
3pt * 2/3 = 2pt
6pt * 2/3 = 4pt
22pt * 2/3 = 15pt
2pt * 2/3 = 1pt

#### matlab

22pt * 2/3 = 15pt
3pt * 2/3 = 2pt

#### latexit

40pt * 2/3 = 27pt

<!-- ## Text font


Fonts matter in presentationsâ€”just as in papers. The font determines the appearance of the entire presentation. For the presentation's text, the template uses [Source Sans Pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro), which is one of the free fonts [recommended by Matthew Butterick](https://practicaltypography.com/free-fonts.html).

Try to use sans-serif font in the figures as wellâ€”it improves readability. Try to choose a font size in the figures so the figure text has the same size as the slide text. This way you are sure that the figure will be easily readable. And make sure that axes and data points are labelled in a self-explanatory way. 

The graphs above are produced with Matlab. I use a sans-serif font (Helvetica) for the text in the graphs to improves readability. I chose the font size in the graphs so the text in the graph is about the same size as footnote text. This way you are sure that the figure will be easily readable (smaller text would be difficult to read).

Source Sans Pro is a sans-serif font. This is an important feature for presentations, as sans-serif fonts are more readable than fonts with serif in presentations. Another advantage of Source Sans Pro is that it is not part of typical slide templates (unlike Fira Sans for instance),  so it feels new and fresh. And since Source Sans Pro was designed in the last decade, it also feels modern.
 -->
<!-- ## Font size

The font size is 11pt. It is easily readable but not too big. It follows [Butterick's advice](https://practicaltypography.com/presentations.html) to choose a font size so as to be able to fit about 12 lines of text on one slide.

The template keeps one font size for all text. So the text is not smaller at different levels of itemized listsâ€”which many Beamer themes impose by default but which is both distracting and clunky.


---

## Text margins

The information on the title slide, section titles, frame titles, and regular text are all aligned along the same left margin. (This requires various adjustments as these elements are not usually aligned in Beamer themes.) Lists are slightly indented to the right.

---

## Color scheme

[As Butterick says](https://practicaltypography.com/presentations.html), color should be used with restraint. A lot of colors, especially bright ones, are distracting. To reduce distraction, the template only uses grayscale. The text is in dark gray (85% black), not complete black, to avoid an uncomfortable degree of contrast. The list items (bullet points and numbers) are in lighter gray, to blend in the background.  Colors are reserved for graphs and text alerts. The typical, bright Beamer bullet points should be avoided as they are distracting.

The color paletters are created by [Color Brewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/)

## Figures

An advantage of avoiding colors in the text is that colors in figures stand out. 

The template uses a white background for slides because figures have white backgrounds. Figures therefore seamlessly blend into the slide. With a colorful slide background, the figures background would stick out.

There is no need to add a caption to the figure in the template: the slide title makes a great caption.

Figures are centered by default. 

An easy way to insert figures into the template is to create a PDF file with all the figures that are featured in the presentation. To do that, create a Keynote or Powerpoint presentation; insert each figure as a slide background; and save the resulting presentation as PDF. With this method, all the figures have the exact same size. It is also possible to use Keynote or Powerpoint to annotate easily the figures created with an external software (Matlab, R, and so on). (See `figures.pdf` in the repository.)

The code for a slide with a basic figure is the following:

```tex
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Figure caption}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figure.pdf}
\end{frame}
```

The code for a slide with multiple figures displayed sequentially is the following:

```tex
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Figure caption}
\includegraphics<1>[scale=0.3,page=1]{figures.pdf}%
\includegraphics<2>[scale=0.3,page=2]{figures.pdf}%
\includegraphics<3>[scale=0.3,page=3]{figures.pdf}%
\includegraphics<4>[scale=0.3,page=4]{figures.pdf}%
\end{frame}
```
